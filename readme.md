# Sapper GraphQL generator for Apollo

GraphQL Code Generator plugin to use Apollo in Svelte with full Typescript support.

## Motivation

[Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com) and [graphql-code-generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com) are a powerfull combination for data management in the front-end.
Unlike other big frameworks, Svelte was still missing a graphql-code-generator plugin for client queries.
It turns out that Svelte with its reactive programming, is particularly well designed to be used together with Apollo

## Install

`npm i -S graphql-codegen-svelte-apollo`

## Configuration

- `clientPath` (default: null): Path to the apollo client for this project (should point to a file with an apollo-client as default export)

Note: typescript and typescript-operations plugins are required.

## Example config

```yml
overwrite: true
schema:
    - 'https://myschema/graphql'
documents:
    - 'src/**/*.{graphql,gql,ts}'
generates:
    output.ts:
        plugins:
            - 'typescript'
            - 'typescript-operations'
            - 'graphql-codegen-svelte-apollo'
        config:
          clientPath: "PATH_TO_APOLLO_CLIENT"
hooks:
    afterAllFileWrite:
        - prettier --write

```

## Usage example

Take for example this query that will request all transactions for one ethereum address

```graphql
# app.gql

fragment TransactionFragment on TransactionDescription {
    contractAddress
    from
    gasUsed
    gasPrice
    input
    isError
    to
    value
}

query Transactions($address: String) {
    transactions(address: $address) {
        ...TransactionFragment
    }
}
```

graphql-code-generator will generate:

```ts
export const TransactionsDoc = gql`
    fragment TransactionFragment on TransactionDescription {
        contractAddress
        from
        gasUsed
        gasPrice
        input
        isError
        to
        value
    }

    query Transactions($address: String) {
        transactions(address: $address) {
            ...TransactionFragment
        }
    }
`;

export const Transactions = (
  options: Omit<QueryOptions<TransactionsQueryVariables>, "query">
): Readable<
  ApolloQueryResult<TransactionsQuery> & {
    query: ObservableQuery<TransactionsQuery, TransactionsQueryVariables>;
  }
> => {
  const q = client.watchQuery({
    query: TransactionsDoc,
    ...options,
  });
  var result = readable<
    ApolloQueryResult<TransactionsQuery> & {
      query: ObservableQuery<TransactionsQuery, TransactionsQueryVariables>;
    }
  >(
    { data: null, loading: true, error: null, networkStatus: 1, query: null },
    (set) => {
      q.subscribe((v) => {
        set({ ...v, query: q });
      });
    }
  );
  return result;
};

```

And use it as follow in your svelte file:

```html
<script lang="ts">
  var address = "0x0000000000000000000000000000"
  $: t = Transactions({ address });
</script>

<ul>
    {#each $t?.data?.transactions ||Â [] as transaction}
        <li>Sent transaction from {transaction.from} to {transaction.to}</li>
    {/each}
</ul>
```
